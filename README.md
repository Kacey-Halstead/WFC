# Wave Function Collapse

This is a project I completed in my own time to generate some interesting terrains based on the Land, Sea, and Coast concept and tutorial by [Robert Heaton](https://robertheaton.com/2018/12/17/wavefunction-collapse-algorithm/).

This project was created in C++ and rendered using SDL2.
